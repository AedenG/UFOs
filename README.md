# UFOs

## Project Overview
Dana is a data journalist, who is from McMinnville, Oregon. Her hometown is an area where UFO sightings have been recorded. She is interested in creating a webpage that contains a filterable table about UFO sightings.

## Resources
Data Source: data.js

## Results

### Filterable Table
The table was created with multiple filter options- including date, city, state, country, and shape. The user can enter text into the filter input boxes and the table will populate the matching data. Input fields can all be completed or some of them can be completed for the matching data to display.

### Potential Drawbacks
To clear the table you must either click on UFO Sightings at the top left of the webpage or clear the inputs and press enter.

If there is no exact match, no data will be displayed.<br><br>

## Summary 

It is very convenient to sort through large amounts of data with options to filter. One drawback of the webpage is that there is no matching data that is returned if the user inputs a filter that does not match the data exactly- such as US instead us for country. I would recommend improving the functionality by allowing for more flexibility of the user input. I also recommend including a button that resets the filters.
